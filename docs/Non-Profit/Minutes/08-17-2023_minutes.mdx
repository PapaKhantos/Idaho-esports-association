  * Major contract - board approval, virtual vote available
  * Gifts/donations - open, a gift or donation is something given with no return expected
  * Anything with an expectation needs either Executive Director or preferably board approval
* 2023-2024 Season
  * On our own again or utilize a 3rd party such as LeagueSpot
    * Going with LeagueSpot. Inquire further about cost. Currently unknown how much IEA actually has.
  * Middle School (middle and junior high typically is middle and junior high)
  * Homeschool students, can’t shop teams (ie choose one and stick with it). Case by case exceptions
  * Exchange can play for their host school. Case by case exceptions
  * Get in with school Athletic Directors
  * Approach IHSAA for a working relationship.
  * Split groups where possible?
    * Mountain time and Pacific time (also late afternoon release schools) cause Mountain to wait an hour to start. Pacific is crunched for time, Mountain long extra duty time for advisors/coaches (especially for unpaid) and family pushback
      * Have a Mountain 3:30 start
      * Have a Pacific 3:30 start
    * Small School/Large School? Two leagues, one for small/starter programs and one for large/established teams. Need to keep both leagues equal in name 2 final matches for each game? Inform of each league and schools can elect to play in either. Teams could appeal.
      * Potato League and Timber League?
  * Limit students to one game a ‘day’ as that will be playoff scenario, make a choice
  * Fall season unlikely, have teams setup virtual tournaments, can we leverage the use of 3rd party?
  * Spring season likely
    * Coordinate with BSU and Doc to see if State is a possibility at the facility (early is better)
    * As U of I builds a program, pursue connections to host event(s) there. Benefits/saves northern schools on cost.
    * Length of season
      * 6 week regular season - groups of 3 or 4
        * Put in seeding (what does LeagueSpot have)
        * Schools playoff against each other
      * Lengthen by two weeks to accommodate playoffs and avoid school day interruption (feedback).
      * Saturday playoff events?
      * Avoid AP testing and spring sports slam in Boise
        * Final event May 10th and 11th or April 19th and 20th, check with Doc
        * Start Feb 19 No ‘spring break’ - last week of BBall and Wrestling
          * Start Feb 12 Everyone gets a free missed week for SB - probably middle of BBall and Wrestling
    * Games:
      * Overwatch 2
      * Valorant
      * Apex Legends
      * Rocket League
      * Super Smash Bros Ultimate

        * Tell everyone to not do the silly
  * Season cost
