##### 3.1.1.1 Map Pool (Based on Official Competitive Pool)

* Ascent
* Bind
* Breeze
* Haven

#### 3.1.2. Map Selection protocol

* Home bans the first map
* Away bans the second map

#### 3.1.3. Tournament Map selection protocol

* After the first round, the losing team would get first map ban and can follow through the map selection protocol as Home, without the option to use the map just played. This leaves 6 maps from which to choose. E.G. the home team would be the losing team and the away team would be the winning team
* Teams are also allowed a 5 minute break and substitute players between matches, if desired.
* All teams are encouraged to complete all matches, but only 2 wins are required to report scores.

## 6. Stoppage of Play

* Shortly after a pause is initiated, a reason must be given to the IEA representative acting as referee for the match (i.g: player disconnect, ping issues, technical difficulties, ect.)
* Each team will have 5 cumulative minutes to pause. When 5 minutes have been exhausted, teams are required to continue play. Both teams should consider keeping track of time.
* Each team is responsible for timing their pause (any issues should be discussed with the opposing team, coaches, and then IEA officials)
* In the case of a player disconnect, after the 5 minutes are used, the team must continue the game (4 v 5)
* If the player is able to reconnect, the player can rejoin the match.
* No subs are allowed to be subbed in the middle of a match.
