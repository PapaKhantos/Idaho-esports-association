Last updated: 2-27-2023
## Verbiage
- Player: A student who is participating in the league.
- Coach: A school district employee or designee who serves as a point of contact for a team. May also be an advisor, club supervisor, or designated student.
- Association: the Idaho High School Esports Association
## Player
- A player may only compete for one school during a season. Should a player move schools in the middle of the season, the player and/or their new coach should contact the Association informing them of the change. More than one movement per season may result in the disqualification of the player for the remainder of the season.
### Additional Requirements:
- Maintain a 2.0 or better on a 4-point system or equivalent. Weighted grades are acceptable.
- Attend the school full-time and/or be on track to graduate. Exceptions:
    - Homeschool students within the school's normal attendance borders are eligible to compete for one school.
    - Schools that have a cooperative agreement allowing for students from another school to play for the school can honor that agreement provided that only one school has an esports team. This must be renewed yearly.
- Be present for the majority (50% + 1) of classes on a competition day, exceptions are for school-excused absences (field trips, athletic events, etc) and doctor-excused absences. Parent call-outs and truancy are not acceptable unless specifically allowed by the sponsoring school or district.
- Exceptions may be made by the IHSEA board to create more opportunities for students.
## School
In order to compete in Association games schools must:
- Be physically located in the State of Idaho, schools not in Idaho are welcome to participate but will not be given tournament spaces.
- Pay dues as assigned (for Spring 2023 this requirement is adjusted to an extended time frame)
- Be a brick-and-mortar school, unless specifically approved by the association. Digital schools such as IDLA and IDVA are generally not approved as students come from other districts. Any exceptions must be renewed yearly.

Schools are expressly prohibited from actively recruiting from other schools, especially those that have esports programs. Recruitment is defined as offering scholarships, deals, or perks for a student to come to their school and play. Schools found in violation of this may have their season forfeited and future participation reviewed. To clarify, students may move schools but it must not be influenced by the receiving school. Further clarification, schools may advertise their programs and equipment to incoming or potential students but cannot make any verbal, physical, or implied promises previously defined.
## Competition

- Additional issues may result in further action from the IHSEA.
### Connection Issues
- If a team has more than 3 disconnects during gameplay that causes pauses or issues the team with the disconnects will forfeit the match. Teams may agree to an alternative day or time if they desire.
### Communication
Each week, coaches are responsible for the following:
- Sending an email or Discord message to your opponent at least 48 hours before the match time to confirm that the match will be played at the default time.
- Updating your Roster on the shared Google Sheet with the players you will be fielding that week. Communicating with the opposing coach, through email, discord, or text message, to ensure fair play between teams and that rules are followed appropriately.
- Communicating with league officials, through email or Discord, the results of the match. 
- MORE communication is always better than less. So communicate EARLY and OFTEN to ensure a smooth game day experience for all students.
### Rosters

### Schedule
Organzations should commit to playing at the default time when joining. Teams are not obligated to adjust their times.
#### Rescheduling:
- Teams are allowed to reschedule provided both teams agree to the agreed upon date and time. This must be communicated from both coaches to IHSEA, preferably by using the Discord chat.
- If teams cannot agree to a rescheduled date and time then the default time stands.
- Opposing teams are not obligated to change from the default time.
- If an alternative date and/or time has been agreed upon by both teams this is the new default time for that specific match.
- It is recommended that teams being asked if a rescheduled date and/or time works, clarify with all team members and families that the reschedule would infact work.
### Match Procedure:
- Teams have 10 minutes from the start of the match time to communicate with the other team that they are planning to compete on that day. Teams in communication with each other should make every effort possible to compete while following the rescheduling guidelines.
- Teams must have full rosters, teams may elect to play a player down, see specific game rules about players joining in late.
### Glitches and Bugs 
- Any use of glitches or bugs is strictly prohibited. If there is any evidence regarding a team using these, an automatic forfeit will be issued.
### Match Reporting
All matches must be reported by 9 pm Mountain / 8 pm Pacific on Friday the week of the match. After that time, any unscored match will be considered a forefeit by both teams.
### Match Dispute
It is encouraged to work out any disputes with the opposing team during the game. Both parties may agree to replay the game, set, or match and accept those results. If agreement cannot be reached then it will go to the dispute team.

Sufficient evidence is required to argue a case. A coach not connected to either team and a part of the IHSEA, may act as referee for the match. A teamâ€™s coach may bring forth any evidence for a dispute, but it is ultimately the determination of the referee if there is sufficient evidence to call for a rematch or disqualify a team.

Communication logs, screenshots, and any replay codes available will assist in the dispute resolution. All disputes should be reported before the match reporting time.
